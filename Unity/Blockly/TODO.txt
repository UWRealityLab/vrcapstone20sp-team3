- continue module dragging UI in BlocklyModuleUIController (look at line 68)
- get debug logs in the quest working (follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtOX6bXcQJE)
  - first see if we can use the hand pointer as an OVRCursor
  - then try the hand-interaction-train-scene approach where you have proximity
    zones, so the cursor snaps to different UI elements
- figure out how to integrate pinch and pointer poses from OVR (https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-handtracking/?locale=en_US#getting-skeleton-mesh-data)
- make sure to leave EmacsClient.cs untracked or detect some env variable to enable it (just something clever)
