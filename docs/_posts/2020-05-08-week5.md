## What we accomplished
We finished our MVP early this week by pair programming in a zoom call to merge the frontend and backend components together. We added a new environment to make the experience more immersive. We also added background music
and sounds when moving and emitting blocks. We created a video and presented our project to the class. We improved our hand gesture
recognition by ignoring very short movement commands and fixed some sensitivity in tracking the emit command.
* Logan: Created and presented core components slides. Improved gesture recognition.
* Sea-Eun: Created and presented plans for the following weeks. Began implementation on main menu.
* Yuma: Created and presented MVP intro slides. Began work on module components in backend and implemented background music.
* Erik: Created and presented MVP video. Debugged gesture saving and implemented sounds.

## Plan for next week
For next week, we want to finalize modules, which includes creating/defining modules as well as reusing previously defined modules from a "module library." 
* Erik:
	* Integrate gesture saving with current MVP
	* Gesture / Pose recognition for module defining (2-handed gesture)
* Logan:
	* Implement clicking things with hand gestures (ie. pinch)
	* Look into using clicking gesture with selecting modules from module library
* Sea-Eun:
	* Implement backend to apply modules from library to current structure
	* Investigate module rotation
* Yuma:
	* Finish backend for module construction and update appearance of block region
	* Add module library to play area
	* Investigate module rotation

## Upcoming Challenges
Since we are adding in support for modules, one challenge we anticipate will be getting a natural flow for interacting with modules since it will require new gestures and UI components. It's entirely possible that working on these components separately and then trying to combine them together will cause unnatural interactions.
