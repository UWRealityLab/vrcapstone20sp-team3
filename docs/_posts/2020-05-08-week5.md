## What we accomplished
We finished our MVP early this week by pair programming in a zoom call to merge the frontend and backend components together. We added a new environment to make the experience more immersive. We also added background music
and sounds when moving and emitting blocks. We created a video and presented our project to the class. We improved our hand gesture
recognition by ignoring very short movement commands and fixed some sensitivity in tracking the emit command.
* Logan: Created and presented core components slides. Improved gesture recognition.
* Sea-Eun: Created and presented plans for the following weeks. Began implementation on main menu.
* Yuma: Created and presented MVP intro slides. Began work on module components in backend and implemented background music.
* Erik: Created and presented MVP video. Debugged gesture saving and implemented sounds.

## Plan for next week
* E: Integrate gesture saving with current MVP
* E: Gesture / Pose recognition for module defining (something with 2 hands for this)
* Module:
    * Module library (how is someone going to reuse an old module?)
        * Need menu UI
        * How do we access this menu (pull down to get menu)? Or is it "always there" --> ie. beside you or below you
    * Maybe we have a confirmation for modules? Like it shows what it will do to your structure and the user could select something
    like "rotate left", etc.
    * Physically grab modules? (for now maybe just have clicks)
        * Possibly throw it
* Implement clicking things with hand gestures (ie. pinch)
    * See
