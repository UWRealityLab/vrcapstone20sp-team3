## What we accomplished
We finished most of the code that supports modules this week. We're planning on meeting up this weekend to integrate everything and make sure it works together.

* Yuma: Implemented backend code to record modules. Added a library where defined modules can be located and reused.
* Sea-Eun: Implemented backend code to select a module and apply it to the current cursor.
* Logan: Started integrating current pose struct with oculus pose struct. Prototyped drag and drop UI for module library via finger pinching.
* Erik: Added buttons that allow users to save and load their current hand poses. Started implementing pose recognition for modules.

## Plan for next week
For next week, we want to finish support for looping and improve the current module experience. If we have any extra time, we will start the tutorial UI/design.

* Yuma: Add support an arbitrary number of modules in the module library.
* Sea-Eun: Add support for saving the new looped module. Also add failure condition for if a module goes out of bounds. Investigate deletion.
* Logan: Oculus + custom pose recognition merge (related to getting pinching/other hand tracking features working for our project)
* Erik: Add a looping gesture. Add a counter to the backend that shows how many times they've looped.

## Upcoming Challenges
The gesture for a loop may be kind of weird. We're currently planning on having the user trace a circle around a pinched module exactly the number of times they want to repeat that module. No more, no less. There are also many unknowns with integrating the current components created by us and the components built into Unity. For example, we want to switch the structs that we're using to store poses to use the struct built into Unity instead of our own, but this will be an extensive refactor. We're having trouble keeping the debugging editor player while simultaneously taking advantage of the more advanced built-in features of hand tracking objects.

We're going to need to decide whether to deprecate the editor player, or if it's worth it to continue to add to it for debugging purposes.
